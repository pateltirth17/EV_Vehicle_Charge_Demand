# EV_Vehicle_Charge_Demand

This project forecasts future electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends using historical vehicle registration data from various U.S. counties. The goal is to help urban planners and policymakers anticipate infrastructure needsâ€”especially EV charging stationsâ€”by identifying growth patterns in battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

ðŸš€ Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed 20,000+ records with missing values and outlier treatment using IQR method

- Time-formatted and encoded vehicle usage and regional data for trend modeling

- Built a Random Forest Regressor to predict EV adoption based on historical and regional features

- Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful data storytelling

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor, Model Evaluation)

- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, Google Colab

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: Kaggle â€“ Electric Vehicle Population Size 2024

ðŸ“Œ Future Scope
- Integrate time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)

- Dashboard with Streamlit or Power BI for interactive forecasting
